Given a state index, a person ID, the time, policy functions, and model
Make a named tuple of data
1. Person ID
2. The time
3. Hours worked
4. Their wage
5. Their EITC usage
6. Earned income
7. Manager status
8. Occ change
9. Age

Produces a data frame of model simulated data given an initial distribution,
    policy functions, and the model.
Optionally provide post, a second model and policy functions for that model
If post is provided, the economy will go through a transition to the new steady state,
    starting halfway through the simulation.

Algorithm: Start with initial distribution of people
Push each person through T periods, keeping track of the person ID
If the person hits retirement, remove them, replace with
a young person, not manager, same other state
A person is a state, an ID, and a time
Init some arbitrary IDs at time 1
When the person retires, reset their state, and give them
    a new ID
When someone is reborn, they become a random draw from the initial dist,
and go through life again
There is a burn-in period so that this rebirth cycle reaches a steady state
